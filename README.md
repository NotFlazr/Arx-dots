# Arxctl
Wondering what Arx is? It's a multi-script command tool I created to handle various system tasks.
This project is also known as -
# Just-A-Beginner-Arch-User-Dots because I started my ricing journey in May 2025 with Arch Linux - the so-called "hardest distro."
Here's the thing: I knew nothing about programming when I started, and I still don't know much. Right now I only know a bit of Bash and Python (which I learned from school), plus maybe 1% of Node.js or JavaScript (I made a Discord bot that failed due to boredom)
# What does this dot contains
it contains a bash file with aliases(so stuff like pacman can be cut short into like pac discord etc) to make your life easier
This dot contains a waybar config that is inspired by the celestia dots
It uses flavours a base 16 builder to theme the various parts of the setup
It uses foot
Consists of a theme switcher and obv the Arx script
A discord that would be themed according to your wallpaper(wallpapers are store in ~/.config/walls also btw this is not tested so don't blame me this is my 1st time on github too lol Disapointed? well what can you expect from a Just a beginner arch user dots ??)
It also uses mako rather than swaync
it uses yin so you can have both live and static img support for the theme switcher(obv swww is better for static but converting mp4 to gif sucks)
Some wallpapers are also provided as its also a repo that is taken as a backup if i reinstall arch
a hyprland config with theming included

I use stow to install these
just git clone
cd into the directory
also make sure to install stow (sudo pacman -S stow)
also make sure you got git
then cd into the directory and do stow .
Make sure you don't delete the files as all the files are linked to the github repo folder
so deleteing it causes alot of issues
